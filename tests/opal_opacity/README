Test to compare sedona Rosseland mean opacities to OPAL results

OPAL data is downloaded from
https://opalopacity.llnl.gov/existing.html

Specifically the file: GN93hz.dat

The file opal_data_header.dat gives information about this file

The files
opal_X1.0_Y0.0_Z0.0.dat
opal_X0.9_Y0.1_Z0.0.dat
Pull tables for specific compositions out of GH93hz.dat

Opal opacities are given as a function of temperature T and log R
where R = rho/(T/1e6)**3

Use snopac and param.lua to caculate for various
compositions, temperatures, densities.
It produces the file: mean_opacities.dat
which gives Sedona rosseland mean opacities
